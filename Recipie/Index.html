            <p>Ingredients: For Tomato Soup</p>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>1 small carrot</li>
            <li>1 celery stick</li>
            <li>
              1.2 litres/2 pints hot vegetable stock (made with boiling water
              and 4 rounded tsp bouillon powder or 2 stock cubes)
            </li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <br />
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <li>
              First, prepare your vegetables. You need 1-1.25kg/2lb 4oz-2lb 12oz
              ripe tomatoes. If the tomatoes are on their vines, pull them off.
              The green stalky bits should come off at the same time, but if
              they don't, just pull or twist them off afterwards. Throw the
              vines and green bits away and wash the tomatoes. Now cut each
              tomato into quarters and slice off any hard cores (they don't
              soften during cooking and you'd get hard bits in the soup at the
              end). Peel 1 medium onion and 1 small carrot and chop them into
              small pieces. Chop 1 celery stick roughly the same size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon 2 tbsp olive oil into a large heavy-based pan and heat it
              over a low heat. Hold your hand over the pan until you can feel
              the heat rising from the oil, then tip in the onion, carrot and
              celery and mix them together with a wooden spoon. Still with the
              heat low, cook the vegetables until they're soft and faintly
              coloured. This should take about 10 minutes and you should stir
              them two or three times so they cook evenly and don’t stick to the
              bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Holding the tube over the pan, squirt in about 2 tsp of tomato
              purée, then stir it around so it turns the vegetables red. Shoot
              the tomatoes in off the chopping board, sprinkle in a good pinch
              of sugar and grind in a little black pepper. Tear 2 bay leaves
              into a few pieces and throw them into the pan. Stir to mix
              everything together, put the lid on the pan and let the tomatoes
              stew over a low heat for 10 minutes until they shrink down in the
              pan and their juices flow nicely. From time to time, give the pan
              a good shake – this will keep everything well mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slowly pour in the 1.2 litres/2 pints of hot stock (made with
              boiling water and 4 rounded tsp bouillon powder or 2 stock cubes),
              stirring at the same time to mix it with the vegetables. Turn up
              the heat as high as it will go and wait until everything is
              bubbling, then turn the heat down to low again and put the lid
              back on the pan. Cook gently for 25 minutes, stirring a couple of
              times. At the end of cooking the tomatoes will have broken down
              and be very slushy-looking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the puréed soup back into the pan and reheat it over a medium
              heat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until you can see
              bubbles breaking gently on the surface. Taste a spoonful and add a
              pinch or two of salt if you think the soup needs it, plus more
              pepper and sugar if you like. If the colour’s not a deep enough
              red for you, plop in another teaspoon of tomato purée and stir
              until it dissolves. Ladle into bowls and serve. Or sieve and serve
              chilled with some cream swirled in

            <p>Ingredients: For the pasta</p>
            <li>12 oz pasta</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>10 oz cooked chicken breast, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>6 fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>3½ oz kalamata olives, sliced</li>
            <li>4 oz feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt, Pepper</li>
            <br />
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <li>
              In a large heavy pot with a lid, combine pasta, 4 cups water and
              olive oil. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook pasta, stirring
              frequently, until al dente. The water should be nearly evaporated;
              this should take about 10 minutes. If water is left in the pan,
              drain pasta before adding the remaining ingredients. <br />
              Add tomatoes, chicken, basil, oregano, olives and cheese. Toss
              together, then add lemon juice, salt and pepper

          <ul>
            <p>Ingredients: For Pancake</p>
            <li>2cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2eggs</li>
            <li>
              2tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted
              butter for cooking, or use neutral oil
            </li>
            <li>1tablespoon sugar, optional</li>
            <li>1½ to 2 cups of milk</li>
            <br />
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof
              platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small
              bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set
              aside<br />
              In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.
              Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened
              (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine)<br />
              Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over
              medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil;
              carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.<br />
              For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,
              using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you
              should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).<br />
              Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have
              burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and
              cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer
              to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil,
              and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining
              batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired
              toppings.
